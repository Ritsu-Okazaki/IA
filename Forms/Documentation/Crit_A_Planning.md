# Criteria A
## Problem definition:
The leader of Tech Crew; lighting and audio crew for school dance and theater performances, has claimed that he has difficulties while playing audio and changing lights corresponding to the theater/dance scripts. For the seamless execution of performances, it is important for them that they promptly follow the instructions on the scripts that the performers provide prior to the practices. Most commonly received formats of tech scripts are online documents and paper, which the leader claims are difficult for the members to follow the cues once they lose track. For example, dance performances require consecutive rapid changes in lighting, which makes the problem prominent especially. Additionally, tech performance requires cooperation of multiple members with different roles, which the leader claims is hard to facilitate with only one document. He claims that using documents for this purpose might be inherently difficult because of the absence of a cursor for cues. As for audio, the audio software that they currently use has instabilities with different audio output devices. Also, the leader reported that the software has far more features than the crew require for their production, which is obfuscating the process. As a result, the crew’s performance is sometimes hindered regardless of the passion and effort by the members for their adoption of document-style scripts.

## Success Criteria:
1. The user can navigate through cues either by time lapse or on-click in the “playback” screen
2. The user can enter cues by FIFO and edit/delete them in the “edit” screen, which will be displayed on the “playback” screen
3. The user can clearly see and distinguish the script portion and the light/audio portion of the cues in the “playback” screen
4. The user can assign each cue to a person in the “edit” screen and display separately in different columns in the “playback” screen
5. In the “save” screen, the user can save/call playbacks that they created in the “edit” screen
6. The user can authenticate themselves through sign-up/login in the “login” screen to personalize their saved playbacks
